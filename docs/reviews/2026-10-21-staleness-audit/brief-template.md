You are an independent reviewer. This is an approved, read-only review: do not
ask for consent. Delete nothing, edit nothing, send nothing, start or stop
nothing. Put the whole report in your final message. Test folders, leave them
alone: tests/, .cache/, ui/node_modules/. Skip any repo startup routine; read
only what this brief names.

WHAT: anyscribe pull request __PR__ (__TITLE__), branch `__BRANCH__`, head commit
__SHA__, against main b3cddc1 (v0.16.5). Checkout to read: __WT__ (a git
worktree of <repo> at that commit). The full diff is
saved at __DIFF__. The audit findings this PR implements are at __SPEC__.
The implementer's own report is at __IMPL__ (treat its claims as claims).

WHY IT EXISTS (the owner's ask, in his words): "Do an end-to-end audit of what
all is out of date and should be updated. Logically file the PRs. Run
independent review on those PRs. If they are good to go, merge them."
FIRST QUESTION: is this the job he asked for, and the right instrument for it?
If the brief, the goal or the spec is wrong, say so instead of reviewing around it.

MUST NEVER HAPPEN: a doc or skill file that tells a user or an agent to run a
command the code rejects; a doc that claims more than the code does; a change
that breaks CI (lint, tests, docs render check, static bundle check) or a user's
install; anything deleted that should not be; behaviour changes smuggled into a
docs PR.
SETTLED, DO NOT REOPEN: yt-dlp's JavaScript-runtime requirement (Deno) and
dropping Python 3.10 are decisions left to the owner, deliberately out of scope.
CHANGELOG.md gets its entries at release time, not in these PRs. The repo's own
docs use em dashes; that is house style, not a defect.
SOURCES: the checkout above (code is the source of truth: src/anyscribe/cli/*.py,
providers/*.py, core/*.py, web/routes/*.py, config/settings.py, scripts/*.py,
.github/workflows/*.yml); the diff; the spec; CHANGELOG.md and BACKLOG.md for
history.

LENS (Every review): Is this the job he asked for? Use it the way he will: a
user reads the doc and types the command, or Claude Code reads the skill and
runs it; which copy does his machine load (the bundled skill under
src/anyscribe/skill is what `anyscribe install-skill` copies to
~/.claude/skills/anyscribe). Claims worded stronger than their evidence.
LENS (Code PR): His goal written as invariants: every documented command, flag,
default, path, JSON field and route must match the code at this commit. Try to
break each fix with concrete inputs: for each changed command example, trace it
through the Typer app in cli/main.py and the subcommand module and say whether
it parses. Tests that cannot fail. The same pattern elsewhere: any other doc
line with the same bug the PR fixed but did not touch. Docs and spec that claim
more than the code does; spec that was wrong and got built anyway. CI on this
exact SHA: a merge verdict is conditional on it.
__EXTRA_LENS__

YOU MAY RUN: read-only commands only (cat, grep, sed -n, git log/show/diff on
the checkout, python -c for parsing). YOU MAY NOT: run pytest, builds,
installs, servers, network calls, or anything that writes. Name any check you
could not run as an exact command so the lead can run it.

REPORT
1. Verdict first: GOOD TO GO / NOT YET / CONDITIONAL on <what>.
2. Round 2+: every earlier finding as FIXED / PARTLY / NOT FIXED / DECLINED-OK,
   one line of evidence each; then NEW defects the fixes introduced.
3. Findings, most severe first, numbered __PREFIX__1, __PREFIX__2...:
   severity (blocker / should-fix / nit, only these words); CONFIRMED (you
   reproduced or traced it) or PLAUSIBLE; where (file:line); what goes wrong,
   as a concrete scenario; the fix (exact replacement wording for docs).
4. Answers to any questions in this brief (advice, not findings).
5. Pending owner checks: things only the owner can confirm. They do not block
   the verdict.
6. What you could not check, and why; any check you could not run, as the
   exact command. What you inspected.
If you find nothing, say so clearly and name what you inspected. No em dashes.
